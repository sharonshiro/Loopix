DisplaySwitch.exe is a legitimate executable file that is part of the Windows operating system, specifically associated with version 10.0.15063.0 published by Microsoft. This utility is primarily used to manage display settings, allowing users to switch between different display modes, such as extending the desktop, duplicating screens, or projecting to a second screen. As a core component of Windows, DisplaySwitch.exe is generally safe and does not pose any threat of virus or malware. However, users may encounter errors related to this file if there are issues with their display drivers or system settings, which can result in functionality problems when trying to connect to external displays. It is important for users to ensure that their system is up to date and to verify that DisplaySwitch.exe is located in the correct directory (C:\Windows\System32) to confirm its legitimacy and avoid any potential security risks associated with malicious software that may disguise itself with a similar name.
